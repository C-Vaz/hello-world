# hello-world
Created using the GitHub guide.

My name is Chris. I am a student who is looking to gain experience programming, in hopes of finding a job. I am currently going to school and I have plenty of experience programming; however, none of it being professionally. I consider my skill level to be somewhere between novice and intermediate, although it is probably closer to intermediate. I have come to GitHub to truly identify my skill level, and improve it. Languages I am familair with: java, python, html, javascript, css, and visual basic. I hope to add more to this list, so they can help me in the job market.
